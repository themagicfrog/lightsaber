# LIGHTSABER

A PCB lightsaber with a gyroscope! This was the first PCB I ever made and it was originally for [The Trail](https://github.com/hackclub/the-trail), an event by [Hack Club](https://github.com/hackclub). The faster you move it, the more LEDs light up. Each of the x, y, and z are assigned to red, blue or green. It has an Arundio Nano microcontroller, NeoPixel lights, and a MPU-6050 gyroscope and accelerometer.

I first designed the entire board separately with a lighthouse theme (as you can tell from the silkscreen), but then decided to change it up. 

Here are some really cool long-exposure light trail photos I took with it!
