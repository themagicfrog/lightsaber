# MAGIC FROG'S LIGHTSABER

This is a PCB lightsaber with a gyroscope and accelerometer! It was originally for [The Trail](https://github.com/hackclub/the-trail), an event by [Hack Club](https://github.com/hackclub). Although this project turned out to be a lot harder than I expected, I finished it in the end! Wahoo! :D

## Features
- LEDs controlled by gyroscope and accelerometer
  * More LEDs light up as you accelerate faster.
  * Each axis (x, y, z) on the gyroscope control a different color: red, blue, or green.

## Components
- Ardunio Nano Microcontroller
- MPU-6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer
- Neopixel LED Strip
- 6V battery
